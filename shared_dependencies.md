Shared Dependencies:

1. **Class Names**: `BaseClient`, `O365Client`, `JIRAClient`, `AuthManager`, `TokenStore`, `DataObject`, `JIRAIssue`, `NotionPage`, `ServiceAdapter`, `O365Adapter`, `JIRAAdapter`, `Logger`, `ErrorHandler`, `ConfigLoader`, `PluginBase`, `PluginLoader`. These classes are shared across multiple files and serve as the building blocks of the library.

2. **Function Names**: Functions such as those for fetching data (`fetch_data`), updating data (`update_data`), and handling errors (`handle_error`) are likely to be shared across multiple files.

3. **Configuration Variables**: Variables related to configuration settings, such as `CONFIG_PATH`, `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, etc., are likely to be shared across multiple files, especially those that need to load or validate configurations.

4. **Authentication Tokens**: Tokens used for authentication, likely stored and retrieved by `AuthManager` and `TokenStore`, are shared across files that need to make authenticated API requests.

5. **Data Schemas**: The structure of data objects, defined by classes like `DataObject`, `JIRAIssue`, `NotionPage`, etc., are shared across files that need to create, manipulate, or store these objects.

6. **Error Messages**: Standardized error messages, likely defined in `ErrorHandler`, are shared across files that need to report errors.

7. **Log Messages**: Standardized log messages, likely defined in `Logger`, are shared across files that need to log events or statuses.

8. **Test Cases**: Test cases, defined in the `unit` and `integration` test files, are shared across files that need to run these tests.

9. **Documentation**: Documentation files like `user_guide.md` and `developer_guide.md` are shared resources that provide instructions for using and contributing to the library.
