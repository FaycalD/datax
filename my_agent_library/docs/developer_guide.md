### Authentication Module

The Authentication Module handles authentication and token management for different services. It consists of `AuthManager` and `TokenStore`.

### Data Models

Data Models define the structure of data being retrieved and manipulated. It consists of a `DataObject` base class and service-specific models like `JIRAIssue`, `NotionPage`, etc.

## Abstraction Layer

### Service Abstractions

Service Abstractions provide a unified interface for interacting with different services. It consists of a `ServiceAdapter` abstract base class and concrete adapters for each service like `O365Adapter`, `JIRAAdapter`, etc.

### Operations Manager
