# My Agent Library User Guide

Welcome to the user guide for My Agent Library. This library is designed to provide a robust Python agent for data setting and retrieval from various cloud and local productivity apps.

## Getting Started

First, you need to install the library. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install my_agent_library
```

## Core Components

### API Client Layer

The API Client Layer is responsible for managing the low-level HTTP requests to various services. You can use the `BaseClient` for general API requests, or use service-specific clients like `O365Client` or `JIRAClient` for specific services.

```python
from my_agent_library.core.api_clients import O365Client

client = O365Client()
```

### Authentication Module

The Authentication Module handles authentication and token management. Use the `AuthManager` to handle the authentication process and `TokenStore` to store and retrieve tokens securely.

```python
from my_agent_library.core.auth import AuthManager, TokenStore

auth_manager = AuthManager()
token_store = TokenStore()
```

### Data Models

Data Models define the structure of data being retrieved and manipulated. Use `DataObject` as a base class for data models, or use service-specific models like `JIRAIssue` or `NotionPage`.

```python
from my_agent_library.core.models import JIRAIssue

issue = JIRAIssue()
```

## Abstraction Layer

### Service Abstractions

Service Abstractions provide a unified interface for interacting with different services. Use `ServiceAdapter` as a base class for adapters, or use service-specific adapters like `O365Adapter` or `JIRAAdapter`.

```python
from my_agent_library.abstractions import JIRAAdapter

adapter = JIRAAdapter()
```

### Operations Manager

The Operations Manager manages high-level operations such as data retrieval, updates, and synchronization. Use `Operation` as a base class for operations, or use service-specific operations like `FetchJIRAIssues` or `UpdateNotionPage`.

```python
from my_agent_library.operations import FetchJIRAIssues

operation = FetchJIRAIssues()
```

## Utility Modules

### Logging and Error Handling

The library provides consistent logging and error handling across the library. Use `Logger` for logging and `ErrorHandler` for error handling and reporting.

```python
from my_agent_library.utilities import Logger, ErrorHandler

logger = Logger()
error_handler = ErrorHandler()
```

### Configuration Manager

The Configuration Manager handles configuration settings for the library. Use `ConfigLoader` to load configurations from files or environment variables.

```python
from my_agent_library.utilities import ConfigLoader

config_loader = ConfigLoader()
```

## Extension and Plugin System

The Plugin Manager allows for extensibility and customization of the library. Use `PluginBase` as a base class for plugins, and `PluginLoader` to dynamically load and integrate plugins.

```python
from my_agent_library.plugins import PluginBase, PluginLoader

plugin_base = PluginBase()
plugin_loader = PluginLoader()
```

## Testing and Documentation

The library includes a testing framework to ensure its reliability and correctness. Refer to the `unit` and `integration` test files for test cases.

For more detailed information on how to use and extend the library, refer to the `developer_guide.md`.

Happy coding!
